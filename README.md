I struggled to get this file to commit due to the size. I received this message:

Citations: 
I primarily referenced a site called Splynters for existing code.  
I also referenced Stack overflow and wall Street Mojo for assitance 
For debugging I used a combination of VBA tools, learn.Microsoft, google, excelchamps.com, Stack overflow and excelmacromastery.com

I am unsure if my commit was accepted due to size.
